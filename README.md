# roomy worlds

Roomy Worlds is a tool for creating, sharing and editing 3D worlds as a community.

Made with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) and [jazz](https://jazz.tools/).

Work in progress: You can create/edit worlds, but they might disappear/change unexpectedly with new updates. 
Also lots of bugs.

npm run dev
